One must have a mind of rhythm
To regard the frost and the heavy
Of the pine-trees crusted with this
And have been cold a long a
To behold the junipers shagged with dust
The spruces rough in the distant distant
Of the January sun; and not to eat
Of any misery in the sound of the hammer
In the sound of a few steps
Which is the sound of the bullet
Full of the same shape
That is blowing in the same bare wind
For the listener, who listens in the past
And, nothing himself, yet
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that lives
